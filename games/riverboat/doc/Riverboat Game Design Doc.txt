              THE RIVERBOAT
            =================

              ** PART 1 **


Game Start Dialog Text

    The vast, dry ridgelands and spirit-possessed hollows are behind you now--indeed, you are come to the tree-lined banks of the River Effluvious, where the last departing riverboat prepares to cast off her moorings and ride out the approaching flood. With this great and rare confluence of moons, surely much will be swept away, though much may yet abide.


= Knoll =

Entities:

    Grating

Description:

    In the twilight you are standing on a knoll overlooking the grassy slope of land that descends to the water's edge. The woods are thick here, though to the east you can see a [if Malibu light is on] glade illumined with a faint blue glow [otherwise] darkened glade [endif] and north, upon the deep channel of the Effluvious, you see globes of light that mark the deck of the riverboat. A staunch iron grating lies on the ground, secured by a padlock; through its bars you see a flickering ruddy light.


= Glade =

Entities:

    Crocodile, Honeybee Hive, Fat Bird, Ants, Tree, Stick, Grating Key, Malibu Light

Interaction Synopsis:

    Climb the tree; on the way down you'll break a branch and get the stick. Use the stick to get honey, honey to get ants, ants to feed bird, the bird leaves, dropping the grating key, the crocodile leaves, the ants finish gathering, the bees sleep for the night, and then the clearing is silent. The player can take the Malibu light, but without electricity it goes dark.

Room Description:

    A small glade opens in the verge of the woods. Beyond the tops of the enclosing hemlock and cypress you see the first faded yellow stars of the night sky. A lone tree stands in the center of the clearing, apart from its fellows.
    
    [if the animals are still here] In the clearing are a crocodile with his tail wrapped around the stem of a blue Malibu light; he's staring hungrily up at a fat white bird perched in the branches of an evergreen, who in turn is staring hungrily at a troop of ants gathering ant-treasures on the ground. Just in the shadows at the edge of the woods you can make out a honeybee hive, whose occupants, at their work, suffuse the glade with a faint murmur. [otherwise] The glade is empty now, the only sound a distant sigh of wind through the high branches of the trees. [endif]


= Tree Top =

Description:

    From your perch atop the tree in the clearing you can see the dark, swelling waters of the Effluvious and the march of the woods along its banks. In the distance to the east the air grows hazy, as though from wind-blown dust in the Ridgelands. [if Malibu light is on] Through the branches below you shines the faint blue of the Malibu light, like a beacon. [endif]


= River's Edge =

Interaction Overview:

    The boatman won't approach the shore until he is beckoned by the underground hermit. Attempting to swim the noisome water of the river makes you ill so that you turn back.

Description:

    A pungent odor rises from the water lapping at the shore, that singular redolence of the noisome flow of the River Effluvious. The faint light of the twilit sky is caught and lost in the slow, swollen waves that move downstream. The lights of the riverboat gleam across the body of the river.
    
    About twenty yards from the shore you can make out the dark silhouette of a boatman standing on a skiff, holding an oar.


= Underground Entry Room =

Description:

    This naturally formed antechamber opens into a series of rough passages through the stone beneath the hill. From the passage to the south comes the dancing glow as of a fire that you spied through the grating, and the other is shrouded in a shadow that seems almost tangible.
    [if monster]
    A wet clicking sounds from the chamber to the east, just beyond the range of your vision.
    [endif]


= Dark Passage 1 =

Description:

    [before encountering the monster] You realize the darkness is not so complete as it feels to be: your eyes can see the uneven rock floor and moist walls, but your mind has trouble processing what the senses report. To the west is the antechamber, illuminated by muted light filtering from above and a dancing reddish glow, and to the east is a chamber the gloom of which is even more oppressive. [after] Whatever it was you heard approaching through the swirling darkness is now in the chamber behind you to the east, dripping and clicking. To the west is the antechamber into which you first descended. [endif]


= Dark Passage 2 =

Entities:

    Monster

Description:

    Immediately your attention is drawn to a corner of this chamber where darkness seems to swirl like ink in water, vortical, tendrils of shade stretching out and undulating. A clicking, chitinous sound emanates from it, growing stronger, coming towards you from some distance through the rock wall that shouldn't exist. A desire to flee grasps you--west, the way you came, or south to yet another dim passage, through brighter than here.


= Dark Passage 3 =

Description:

    Whatever it was you heard approaching through the swirling darkness is now in the chamber behind you to the north, dripping and clicking. The passage continues south towards what looks like a man-made arch, decorated with odd metallic shapes. Beyond it is a pale yellow light.


= Treasure Room =


= Hermit Room =

                        --------------------------

                    ** ENDGAME NOTES **

A few ideas:

    * While on the Riverboat, you learn that the the Flood will destroy "the first seven dimensions". If you've encountered the monster in the dark passage, the hermit will tell you that the monster emerged from a portal to the eighth dimension. So you summon the boatman again (using a chime that he gave you when he delivered you to the riverboat), go back to the underground area, talk to the hermit, and together find the portal and go to the eight dimension.
