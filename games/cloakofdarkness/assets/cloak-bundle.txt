}

[foyer-description (flowed)]

The foyer of the opera house is empty, shadows gathering in the folds of
the threadbare curtains and cracks of doors and windows.

[ bar ]

    "id" : "bar",
    "name" : "Bar",
    "exitName" : "Bar",

}

[ bar-description (flowed) ]

The bar is now lit, and you can see its empty shelves and cracked
countertop. Only a pile of sawdust remains; it seems to have
a message scrawled in its dry chips.

[dark-bar-description (flowed)]

The bar is strangely dark, as though light were being sucked out of the air itself.

[ cloakroom ]

{
    "id" : "cloakroom",
    "name" : "Cloakroom",
    "description" : "[[cloakroom-description]]"
}

[cloakroom-description (flowed)]

The cloakroom possesses a sturdiness that the other rooms in the old opera house
seem to lack.

Your eye is drawn to a brass hook mounted along one wall.

[ patio ]

{
    "id" : "patio",
    "name" : "Patio",
    "description" : "Fake Patio"
}

[ purgatory ]
{
    "id" : "purgatory",
    "name" : "Strange Purgatory",
    "description" : "[[purgatory-description]]"
}

[ purgatory-description (flowed)]

You find yourself in a room outside of time and space, unable to leave,
devoid of material and companionship forevermore.

                ** THE END **

[ purgatory-wait-message ]

Time passes...or so you think, in this place where time has no meaning.

[ cloak ]

{
    "id" : "cloak",
    "name" : "Velvet Cloak",
    "listName" : "Cloak",
    "description" : "[[cloak-description]]",
    "imageName" : "cloak",
    "attributes" : ["wearable", "takeable"]
}

[cloak-description (flowed)]

This velvet cloak is black, so black that it seems a hole in the
fabric of the world itself. If you stare at it for more than a
second, even the periphery of your vision starts to go dark.

[ hook ]

{
    "id" : "hook",
    "name" : "Brass Hook",
    "description" : "The brass hook shines as though glowing with an inner light."

[ dark-bar-junk1 ]

{
    "id" : "dark-bar-junk1",
    "name" : "Mounded Shape",
    "description" : "A strange mound of objects, which you can't make out clearly in the dark."
}

[ dark-bar-junk2 ]

{
    "id" : "dark-bar-junk2",
    "name" : "Vague Cube",
    "description" : "It is too dark to see exactly what this large cube is."
}

[ dark-bar-junk3 ]

{
    "id" : "dark-bar-junk3",
    "name" : "Draped Form",
    "description" : "In the shadowy space of the dark bar, you can't see what is under the cloth drape."
}

[ player-state ]

{
    "currentRoom" : "foyer",
    "worn" : ["cloak"]
}


[ no-go-patio (flowed) ]

The Phatom of the Opera is on the patio--you decide not to
go outside after all.

[ cloak-hung-description ]

It is hanging on the hook.

[ hang-cloak-parser-message ]

> HANG CLOAK ON HOOK

[ hang-cloak-message ]

You hang the strange cloak on the hook.

[ unhang-cloak-message ]

You take the strange cloak off the hook.

[ dark-bar-action-warning ]

It is probably best not to disturb mysterious things in the dark.

[ endgame-message ]

Scrawled in the sawdust is a message:

  "You have ${wonlost}."

When you read the message your vision blurs and you feel yourself
thrown through a rift in reality.

[ win-lose ]

won|lost
