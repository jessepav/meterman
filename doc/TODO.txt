[Actually, don't do this:  the frame images are still visible when the dialogs appear, so there's still
 some graphical feedback (like entity image) while viewing dialog text. If I want to ensure that the images
 are visible I could position the dialogs to the immediate right of the FrameImagePanel instead of the center
 of the frame.]

   Add a side image panel to the XxxDialogS, that accepts the same imageName parameter as the frame image.
   If the imageName is null, the panel will be hidden (set a preferred size of 150x400). I don't need a
   custom JPanel subclass for this, but can just pop an Image into an ImageIcon and use a JLabel.
