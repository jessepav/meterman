- clear sound manager and UI images when starting or loading a game

- unify UI-reset logic in new- and load-game

- Add "loadImage(Path p, String imageName)", "unloadImage(String imageName)", "unloadAllImages()", methods to
  MetermanUI, change setXXXImage() methods to use an image-name instead of a BufferedImage, so that games
  don't have to touch the java.awt API. Remember to unloadAllImages() when starting/loading a game. This way
  we can also keep the default frame-image around, references by a special name.
  
- [Actually, don't do this:  the frame images are still visible when the dialogs appear, so there's still
   some graphical feedback (like entity image) while viewing dialog text. If I want to ensure that the images
   are visible I could position the dialogs to the immediate right of the FrameImagePanel instead of the center
   of the frame.]
   
     Add a side image panel to the XxxDialogS, that accepts the same imageName parameter as the frame image.
     If the imageName is null, the panel will be hidden (set a preferred size of 150x400). I don't need a
     custom JPanel subclass for this, but can just pop an Image into an ImageIcon and use a JLabel.

- Add a sort of "DelegatingEntity" which forwards its various methods to a handler object, the methods of
  which accept an additional parameter of the DelegatingEntity itself. This allows one class to implement
  custom behavior for many different entities. The delegate can differentiate individual entites by
  comparing by identity--since it knows which entities were created when the world was instantiated--or
  by some custom ID field added to DelegatingEntity (which will actually be the custom entity class for
  a particular game).

- BeanShell implementations of the delegate (used by DelegatingEntity), and of the world initialization
  routine.

- The logic of updating the UI to reflect world changes is getting tangled: I should probably just refresh
  the UI at the start of every turn, or implement some sort of notification system to queue up requests to
  update the different parts of the UI.

- Write the Riverboat, modifying the engine as-needed to enable required features.
