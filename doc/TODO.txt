Add keyboard shortcuts to the main frame for activating the exit buttons.

Talk topics have two list fields: add topics and remove topics, which add and remove additional topics,
respectively, from the entity's topics list when that topic is selected. This way whole conversation
trees can be specified in JSON, so long as they don't depend on external state. Make a "conversing
entity" that implements the conversation running. Its JSON has an "initial topics" array of topics.

Write a "frame image manager" that tracks player movements and sets the frame image appropriately.

Implement Cloak of Darkness (see firthworks.com description)

Write the Riverboat, modifying the engine as needed to enable required features.

[Actually, don't do this:  the frame images are still visible when the dialogs appear, so there's still
 some graphical feedback (like entity image) while viewing dialog text. If I want to ensure that the images
 are visible I could position the dialogs to the immediate right of the FrameImagePanel instead of the center
 of the frame.]

   Add a side image panel to the XxxDialogS, that accepts the same imageName parameter as the frame image.
   If the imageName is null, the panel will be hidden (set a preferred size of 150x400). I don't need a
   custom JPanel subclass for this, but can just pop an Image into an ImageIcon and use a JLabel.
