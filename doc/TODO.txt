Write the Riverboat, modifying the engine as needed to enable required features.

Add an option in the startup screen to download and install games from the web.

"Special action manager", that allows the user to type an action name to send to the selected object.

Replace TinySound with PaulsCode SoundSystem

Add XML support to WorldBuilder (and remove JSON support?). Turn TextBundle into XML?

== Things I won't do ==

Add a "transcript" and "replay" feature that operates in terms of UI events: exit-selected,
entity-selected, entity-action-performed. In the absence of randomness, this should bring a game to the
same state at which the transcript ends. It will be saved in a serialized format. New menu in UI,
Transcript; menu items "Begin recording...", "End Recording", "Replay", "View". Ay...this won't work,
because of "extra-UI" actions like TalkingEntities, or custom list- or prompt-dialogs, etc. Nevermind.
Maybe we could just make, eventually, a WorldState viewer/editor.
