Doors can also be open or closed. We need one more pair of openMessages[] (since the door cannot be open and locked at the same time). Only when the door is closed do we go to the locked- and unlocked-messages.

Write a BasicWorldManager that will implement various listeners and handle things like taking and dropping
items, wearing, equipping, and updating the status bar.

Write a "frame image manager" that tracks player movements and sets the frame image appropriately.

Write the Riverboat, modifying the engine as needed to enable required features.


== Things I won't do ==

[Actually, don't do this:  the frame images are still visible when the dialogs appear, so there's still
 some graphical feedback (like entity image) while viewing dialog text. If I want to ensure that the images
 are visible I could position the dialogs to the immediate right of the FrameImagePanel instead of the center
 of the frame.]

   Add a side image panel to the XxxDialogS, that accepts the same imageName parameter as the frame image.
   If the imageName is null, the panel will be hidden (set a preferred size of 150x400). I don't need a
   custom JPanel subclass for this, but can just pop an Image into an ImageIcon and use a JLabel.
