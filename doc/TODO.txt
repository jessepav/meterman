- clear sound manager and UI images when starting or loading a game

- unify UI-reset logic in new- and load-game

- Add "loadImage(Path p, String imageName)", "unloadImage(String imageName)", "unloadAllImages()", methods to
  MetermanUI, change setXXXImage() methods to use an image-name instead of a BufferedImage, so that games
  don't have to touch the java.awt API. Remember to unloadAllImages() when starting/loading a game. This way
  we can also keep the default frame-image around, references by a special name.
  
- Add a side image panel to the TextDialog, that accepts the same imageName parameter as the frame image.
  If the imageName is null, the panel will be hidden (set a preferred size of 150x400). I don't need a
  custom JPanel subclass for this, but can just pop an Image into an ImageIcon and use a JLabel.

- Write the Riverboat, modifying the engine as-needed to enable required features.
