Write the Riverboat, modifying the engine as needed to enable required features.

Write a "frame image manager" that tracks player movements and sets the frame image appropriately.

== Things I may or may not do ==

Add an option in the startup screen to download and install games from the web.

"Special action manager", that allows the user to type an action name to send to the selected object.

== Things I won't do ==

[Actually, don't do this:  the frame images are still visible when the dialogs appear, so there's still
 some graphical feedback (like entity image) while viewing dialog text. If I want to ensure that the images
 are visible I could position the dialogs to the immediate right of the FrameImagePanel instead of the center
 of the frame.]

   Add a side image panel to the XxxDialogS, that accepts the same imageName parameter as the frame image.
   If the imageName is null, the panel will be hidden (set a preferred size of 150x400). I don't need a
   custom JPanel subclass for this, but can just pop an Image into an ImageIcon and use a JLabel.
