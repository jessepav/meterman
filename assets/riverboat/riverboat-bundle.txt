[#Description of -info entries]

The keys of the JSON objects correspond to the names of member properties of BaseEntity and
BaseRoom, though different Room and Entity implementations may recognize additional properties.

For text properties, the values can either be strings, in which case they'll be used directly,
or an array of strings, in which case the (usually first) string in the array will be treated
as the name of a bundle entry whose contents will be used for the property.
