/**
 * Contains various base classes and implementations for rooms and entities.
 * <p/>
 * Some of these may be useful in designing your own world model, and some are
 * provided as examples of how certain features could be implemented. The
 * interface-based nature of rooms and entities admits of rather idiosyncratic
 * world models in individual games, so for unusual effects you might like to
 * write your own implementations.
